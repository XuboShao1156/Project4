# Implementation
## TCP Features
1. Data integrity: checksum generation for outgoing packets and verification for incoming packets.
2. Connection: three-way handshake to establish the connection and four-way wave to teardown the connection.
3. Reliable communication:
    - Accept out-of-order incoming packets and guarantee the correct order to deliver,
    - Identify and discard duplicate packets,
    - Retransmit packet after the timeout of 1 min.
4. Congestion control: a basic congestion window which increases by the amount of successful acknowledged bytes and resets to 1 after timeout or packet drop
